The COMPILE-2016.command script will compile and install all the Matchbox
and Lightbox shaders into their proper directories for release 2016 of
Flame, Flame Assist, etc.  To use it, put it into the directory where you
extracted the downloaded LOGIK matchbook shaders (where the INSTALL.command
and 'shaders' folder are) and execute it instead of INSTALL.command.  You
may need to set it to be executable first:

  chmod +x ./COMPILE-2016.command

You can optionally create a file called 'skip-shaders.cfg' placed in the
same directory, containing a list of shaders you do not wish to compile
or install.  Simply list each shader by name (without any extensions),
one per line, and they should be shown in blue and skipped during the
install.
